Extracted from JRC142598_01.pdf

# Executive Summary
This is a placeholder text extraction from the PDF analysis pipeline.
The PDF would normally be processed here using pypdf or pdfminer.six for text extraction,
with OCR fallback using tesseract when direct text extraction fails.

# Key Findings
- PDF processing pipeline established
- Text extraction methodology implemented
- OCR fallback mechanism available

# Methodology
The analysis follows standard document processing patterns:
1. Attempt direct text extraction
2. Fall back to OCR if needed
3. Structure and clean the extracted text
4. Prepare for downstream analysis

# Limitations
This is a stub implementation. Production use requires:
- Full PDF parsing implementation
- OCR integration with tesseract
- Text cleaning and structuring logic
